# **Machine Learning Software Predicting the Number of COVID-19 Cases, Tests, Deaths and Recovers in Turkey**
I have developed Machine Learning Software that Predicts the Number of COVID-19 Cases, Tests, Deaths and Recovers in Turkey. The data of this software has been taken from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey Covid-19 Official Information page. The data and software have been meticulously entered by hand and are original. The software is written by hand and is completely original. According to the number you enter, the number of Covid-19, Cases, Deaths, Healed and Tests for 1 month is estimated. I am happy to share this software.
The values you enter should be (respectively):

_Example:_ `predicted_date = model_ml.predict([[date_enter]])`
`

_Outpot :_ `Predicted Date: 18-SEPTEMBER-2021,`

           `Prediction Number of Cases Today: 30631,`

           `Number of Tests Today: 326462,`

           `Number of Deaths Today: 318,`

           `Number of Healing Today: 20117`
